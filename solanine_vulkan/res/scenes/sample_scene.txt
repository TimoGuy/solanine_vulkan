# NOTE: when you copy an object, it's just copying all the information needed onto the clipboard to paste/duplicate
#       the object. It will paste the object at the same position (remember that entities don't have a "position") as where you copied it (regenerating the uuid btw).


# NOTE: there will be no CUT (ctrl-x) keyboard shortcut either.


# TODO: create a nice palette scene, and then it'd be easier to copy and paste stuff into other scenes


# NOTE: I thought of doing some kind of prefab idea where it'd load from a file... but that's too much I think.
