    - [ ] Sword enters "cracked state"
        > Some really powerful swords may start like this bc they were thrown away in the cracked state.
        > There is a chance that a hit may cause the sword to break. It could be just the tip, or the middle, or the base (depends on chance). The sword is still usable at all times

    - [ ] Throwing away the blade.
        > You can just flick the blade off with the pull of a trigger, then pull out another blade from your arsenal.

    - [ ] Switching blades.
        - [ ] #Throwing away the blade.
        - [ ] Put away blade

- [ ] @TO_DESIGN: blade inscription to add powers.
    > IDEA: discover these kanji characters that hold meaning when learning about the world and reading books. Can consult a carver to inscribe this character onto the _data_ of the blade stored in your Ancient Weapon. Then, the next time you materialize that blade, you can use the inscription.
            Ideas for script effects:
            - Extra elemental power.
            - Guaranteed best break pattern (furthest out part breaks off every time).
            - Extra durability.
    > REPLY: The way to obtain these carving patterns should be from books. You'll have to have the certain transformation to read the text in the book, then you'll have to find the book. You store the book's information in your Ancient Weapon.
