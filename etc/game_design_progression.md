NOTE: "you" means "the player"

## Part 1
- Gondolas
    - Different tiers of gondola rides.
        - Local
        - Sub-express
        - Express
        - Shink

    - You start out in a shut-off Local network that has like 4 stops.
        - The 4th stop is the big station that joins a couple local networks with a sub-express, but the ticket gate is soft-blocked by a bunch of difficult enemies.
        - If you get a certain item within the local network, you can slowly get around the enemies to another local network.
        - If you get a certain item in the other local network, you can defeat all the enemies and get into the sub-express network.

    - Along the way to the big station, there will be a sub-express train that always passes by you.
        - If you know/have the item to get on top of the train, you can jump from this one to the sub-express train.

> @NOTE: the below island archipelagos can be any order in the train line, it's just that the player spawns after death in the first one.
- First island archipelago.
    - Your house, along with other villagers' homes in a cutout suburb looking thing. The neighborhood is deserted, but filled with materials for the taking. The station is at the end of the street.
        - Some of the homes are unlocked, and you can take those ones's materials easily.
        - Some of them are locked or barred by some other method where you will be able to get into better as you progress thru the game.
        - One of the homes is just an empty home with a cannon (and the roof is missing)
            - Being able to get into this one and light the cannon can get you a huge head-start in the game.
    > @NOTE: these are all things to get you caught up if you die during your adventure.
        > @NOTE: about the temples and death, each of the gods should grant you the ability to revive yourself from death and get another chance at the temple (probably fighting the boss), however, after you do that, you get pulled back to right before entering the room you were in when you died, but now you don't have the blessing to get revived. If you die, you die for real, but once you travel back to the temple, you will get the revival blessing again.

- Second island archipelago.
    - Cavern to learn first two-handed sword waza.
        - "The Gust Wall"
            > @NOTE: this is the certain item that will open up a passageway to get around the horde of enemies to the neighboring Local network.

- Third island archipelago.
    - Village with survivors.
